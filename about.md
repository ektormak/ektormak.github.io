Some information about you!

About me
​
My name is Ektor Makridis and I recently graduated from the University of Manchester with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My interests include Web Development, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning and Computer Vision among others. I am a passionate Python developer specializing in scientific Python with a solid mathematical background.

### Thesis
​
The goal of this project is to extend existing Sparse Coding systems and analyse their performance in a variety of visual recognition tasks. Through a series of experiments we showed that Sparse Coding excels in scenarios of limited supervised training where other Deep Learning methods are prone to overfitting. You can view my complete thesis here.

My complete CV


As part of my undergraduate thesis, I developed Lyssandra, which is a software library that provides the tools to solve Computer Vision problems like object recognition and detection using Sparse Coding algorithms. I implemented a wide range of Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning algorithms which can be used to extract discriminative features from high dimensional data. Most of the implementations are parallel and support memory mapping(change this nobody knows and cares about memory mapping) which is suitable for handling large datasets.
